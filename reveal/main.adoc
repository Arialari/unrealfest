- Splash Engine & Merges


== Disclaimer
[float=left]
image::icon/megaphone.svg[SD, 200, 200]

[float=right]
- Share our learnings
  * from some AAA projects
  * mostly from prototypes
  * years of UE4 work
- Find your inspiration!


== Teams and *Projects*
image:icon/UE4.jpg[UE] image:icon/team.svg[teams, 128, 128]

[.step]
- 300 employees
- Split across multiple ongoing projects
- Some projects use **Splash Engine**
  * vanilla + own modules and enhancements

== Game *Modules*
We strive to have multiple independent modules (as opposed to 1 monolithic one)

[.step]
- Helps with encapsulation and architecture
- Allows faster iteration
  * linkage improvements
  * Editor Hot-Reload
- Promotes re-use throughout projects

== *Quick & Dirty* Automation
- `GenerateModule.cmd`
- Batch file script that produces
  * folder structure
  * initial _...build.cs_ file with good defaults for us


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-UE.jpg"]
== Coding *Standards*


== About
- Splash values *MASTERY* especially in *C++*
- We didn't have an established coding standard
  * some attempts to document it in _wiki's_ 


== Pitfalls
[.step]
- Grow big / Hard to navigate
- Get _out-of-date_ quickly
- In separate location
  * outside production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! üòõ


== Splash Damage approach
[.step]
- Standards are **source code files** üìë
  * you can break the build messing with the standard!
- Created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy _reference_ and _searching_


== The Coding Standard
[.step]
- 2 files
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.h`
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp`
- Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`
- *Open Source*
  * https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards

== Usage
Applied via code reviews

image::code-std/review-1.png[code review pic]


== Usage (continued)
Takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental

image::code-std/review-2.png[code review pic]


== Modify and *Improve*
- The standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team
- If enough up-votes ‚Üí the proposal gets submitted


== Unintended Consequences
...


== Unintended Consequences
image::code-std/coding-actor.png[ue4 coding actor]


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-4.jpg"]
== Content *Standards*


== Motivation
[.step]
- Poor organisation and practices for assets
  * ... compound over time
  * ... waste productivity
  * ... increase cooking and deployment times
- UE4 Editor is easy to modify to
  * improve workflows
  * enforce good practices


== Asset Naming Rules
image::content-std/template.png[asset template, width="125%"]

[.step]
- Less confusion and improves searching & browsing
- `Prefix` uses _initialism_ rules


== Asset Naming Example
image::content-std/example_1.png[assets ex]


== Blueprint Standards
- Same principles as the Coding Standard
- Live in `Game/Content/Standard/`


[%notitle]
== Blueprint Standards Ex. 1
image::content-std/blueprint-standard-1.png[blueprint std ex 1]



[%notitle]
== Blueprint Standards Ex. 2
image::content-std/blueprint-standard-2.png[blueprint std ex 2]


== Blueprint Standards (cont.)
- We have some basic automatic validators
- Best gain for us:
  * enforcing comment nodes


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-5.jpg"]
== Content *Validation*


== Automated Validation
[.step]
- CI (Continuous Integration) support
  * validation after submit
  * nightly builds
- *Naming* Validation
- *Blueprints* Validation
- *Assets* Validation


== *Naming* Validation
[.step]
- Automated checker / validator
  * Editor commandlet
  * _Initialism_ from asset class name
    * extra JSON file with exceptions
- Disallow names like `Test`, `Prototype`, `Error`
- Intercept new asset creation...


== Asset auto-naming on creation
image::content-std/ue4-auto-naming.gif[auto naming, width="150%"]


== *Asset import* rule
- Disallow import from _non-versioned_ paths
- Forbidden example:
  * adding data from own Desktop folder üíÄ


== *Blueprints* Validation
[.step]
- Editor commandlet
- Basic checks
  * _comment_ nodes present
  * public functions / vars must have _tooltips_
  * no functions / vars with _default names_
- Future work & ideas
  * leverage the engine Blueprint Compiler
  * more complex checks


== *Assets* Validation
[.step]
- For all content - done in CI system
- Check for missing or bad references
- Disregard/Disallow `Developer`, `Test` folders
  * historically a major pain point for us

== *Assets* Validation (cont.)
[.step]
- How it works
  * leverage the cooking process
  * `-COOKALL -DUMPALLWARNINGS -WARNINGSASERRORS`
- Not viable for large projects ‚ö†Ô∏è
  * explore other possibilities
  * ex: dependency walker via Editor Asset Registry


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-T.jpg"]
== *Compilation*

== Hardware
[.step]
- Everyday work is very CPU intensive
- CPU hardware threads
  * jump from 8 to 16 substantial (2x)
  * same from 16 to 32
  * diminishing returns after

== *Distributed* compilation
[.step]
-  _Incredibuild_ for some projects
  * expensive - needs to be budgeted for
- We also tried _Fastbuild_
  * free but more difficult to integrate


== *Build Farm*
[.step]
- Different config and layout _per project_
- Best performer machine
  * AMD Threadripper 1950x (16c/32t)
  * full Editor rebuild in ~15min
- Orchestration
  * _TeamCity_ - most projects
  * _Jenkins_


== Infrastructure-*As-Code*
[.step]
- In the past we used ad-hoc methods that didn't scale well
- Too tight integrated with the CI orchestrator ‚ùå
- Too bespoke for a project - cannot reuse ‚ùå
- Hard to debug locally ‚ùå
- Now leveraging Epic's own _BuildGraph_ ‚úÖ


== *BuildGraph*
- Alternative to traditional `BuildCookRun` batch commands
- XML based scripts


== *BuildGraph* - Our Usage
[.step]
- Standardized and reusable set of scripts üìë
- Unifies all calling paths
  * Visual Studio
  * Editor - Hot Reload
  * command line
  * CI systems


== *BuildGraph* (cont.)
[.step]
- Powerful out of the box
  * some good examples in the Engine
- We modified it quite a lot
- Our most complex use-case:
  * prepare zipped Editor binaries

== Pre-*Commit*

== Context
[.step]
- We follow _"trunk-based-development"_
- Only one main dev branch (per project)
  * split off only for major releases
- Everybody submits collaboratively
  * less overhead, fast iteration üëç
  * breakages have large impact üëé

- {nbsp}


== How it works
- Effectively 2 systems working together
- *Frontend*
  * what the devs interact with
- *Backend*
  * CI / build-machines


== Pre-Commit *Frontend*
[.step]
- Tools that allow indirect submits to main code base
- Off-the-shelf
  * Visual Studio ReSharper Team City plugin
  * https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/
- Internally developed
  * more project specific
  * written in C# or Python  


== *Example*: Visual Studio ReSharper
image::tools/pre-commit.png[resharper]

== Pre-Commit *Backend*
- _Personal Build_ system
  * starts CI build configuration in isolation
  * more configurations -> better coverage üòäÔ∏è
  * more configurations -> stress on build farm ‚òπÔ∏è


== Pre-Commit *Backend* (cont.)
[.step]
- We came up with compile time-saving solution
  * rebuild all participating configurations nightly
  * incremental (non-unity) builds throughout the day
- Example:
  * _Editor_ + _Game(PC)_ + _Game(PS4)_
  * Overnight: 1.5-2h on fastest machine
  * Daily: *5-15 min* per commit check


== *Takeaway*
- Major productivity booster
- Pioneered in one project for 1 year
  * spreading it to others
- Not a silver bullet


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/DB-1.jpg"]
== Automation & *Testing*

== Commit Preparation
[.step]
- *Perforce Changelist* descriptions
  * Being verbose is very useful but tiring
- We developed tools that assist in:
  * writing _title_ and _description_
  * adding  _tags_ like `[Feature]` `[BugFix]` etc
  * links to _code reviews_ or JIRA


== Commit Preparation (cont.)
image::tools/pct-tool.png[pct]


== Commit Validation
[.step]
- *Perforce Submit* validation tool
- Changelist formatting
- Time of day
  * to allow time for tests
- No commits when build is broken
  * unless special `[BuildFix]` token


== Commit Validation (cont.)
image::tools/trigger-tool.webp[trigger, width="85%"]

== *Unit* Testing
Testing plain classes and structs or single UObjects

We enhanced UE4's own framework

[.step]
- follow Given / When / Then structure
- separate standards file
- integrated with CI (ex: TeamCity)
- setup & tear-down support

== Unit Test Code Surf

== *Functional* Testing
Blueprint actors in special setup levels to test more complex interactions

[.step]
- Live under `Game/Content/Test/...`
- Named `FTEST_` to follow Epic's convention and for visibility
- Not network capable
  * Look into recent UE4 additions: _Gauntlet_


== *Test Modules*
Very useful to access private data from equivalent runtime module

[.step]
- Our solution
  * `MODULENAME_TEST_API` extension to API specifier macros

== *Test Modules* (cont.)
[source, cpp]
Player\Runtime\Private\Components\SDPlayerCameraTargetComponent.h

[source, cpp]
-----
UCLASS()
class PLAYER_TEST_API USDPlayerCameraTargetComponent : 
    public UActorComponent,
    public IBICameraTarget
{
...
-----

== *Test Modules* (cont.)
[source, cpp]
Player\Test\Private\SDPlayerCameraTargetComponentTest.cpp

[source, cpp]
-----
IMPLEMENT_MODULE_TEST(FAttachedToPlayer_GettingAttachmentInfo_ReturnsCameraRootW
{
    // Given a camera target component attacher to a player with attachment sock
    USDPlayerCameraTargetComponent* CameraTargetComponent = Player->CameraTarget
    CameraTargetComponent->SetSocketName(SDPlayerCameraTargetComponentTestHelper
...

[%notitle]
== CI Tests Integration
image::tools/tc-tests.png[TC tests]


== Editor Automated *Distribution*
UnrealGameSync (UGS)

image::tools/UGS.png[UGS]

== UnrealGameSync
[.step]
- The concept of *Last-Known-Good* Editor build
- Very useful for non-programmers
  * we stripped out the compilation support
- We refactored the packaging script via BuildGraph
  * more control, adding debug symbols upload


== *Takeaway*
- Automation is an worthwhile investment
- Must be done early in lifetime of projects


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/DB-2.jpg"]
== *Splash* Engine

[%notitle]
== About
We extract and re-use the UE work across projects into *Splash Engine*

[.step]
- game-agnostic engine enhancements & fixes gathered across time
- UI components library
- Audio utilities
- Events, Async Tasks library
- Rendering features
- Tech-Art utilities (instancing, decal manager, etc)


== Overview
[.step]
- Majority of projects get seeded from *Splash Engine*
- Downstream integrations
  * "Engine" tends to be at latest UE4 version
  * projects update at their own pace
- Upstream integrations
  * some projects will bubble-up important features

== *Takeaway*
- Allows us to have quick integrations
- Decouples main game dev work from integration work
- Needs dedicated resources otherwise it atrophies
  * we have small *Tech Sharing* group 


== One Last Thing
[.step]
- We did the UE4 4.21 integration following all this
- ...pre-commit everything
- ...ran all the CI tests
- and then when opening the Editor...
