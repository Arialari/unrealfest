== Agenda
- Teams and Projects
- Standards
- Validation
- Compilation
- Automation & Testing
- Projects Structure
- Splash Engine & Merges


== Disclaimer
[float=left]
image::icon/megaphone.svg[SD, 200, 200]

[float=right]
- Share our learnings
  * what worked well üëç
  * what didn't üëé
- Get inspired!

TODO: rewrite this 'start with why' "if you explain to them why each part of our process in Splash, and on Leviathan in particular, was so amazing, and why they need it"

== Teams and *Projects*
image:icon/UE4.jpg[UE] image:icon/team.svg[teams, 128, 128]

[.step]
- 300 employees
- Split across multiple ongoing projects
- Most projects use **Splash Engine**
  * vanilla + own modules and enhancements


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-UE.jpg"]
== Coding *Standards*


== About
- Splash values *MASTERY* especially in *C++*
- We didn't have an established coding standard
  * some attempts to document it in _wiki's_ 


== Pitfalls
[.step]
- Grow big / Hard to navigate
- Get _out-of-date_ quickly
- In separate location
  * outside production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! üòõ


== Splash Damage approach
[.step]
- Standards are **source code files** üìë
  * you can break the build messing with the standard!
- Created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy _reference_ and _searching_


== The Coding Standard
[.step]
- 2 files
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.h`
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp`
- Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`
- *Open Source*
  * https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards


[%notitle]
== The Coding Standards (cont.)
image::code-std/vs-standards-open.gif[VS code std]


== The Coding Standards Surfer
TODO: surf: code std

== Usage
Applied via code reviews

image::code-std/review-1.png[code review pic]


== Usage (continued)
Takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental

image::code-std/review-2.png[code review pic]


== Modify and *Improve*
- The standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team
- If enough up-votes ‚Üí the proposal gets submitted


== Unintended Consequences
image::code-std/coding-actor.png[ue4 coding actor]


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-4.jpg"]
== Content *Standards*


== Motivation
- Poor organisation and practices for assets
  * ... compound over time
  * ... waste productivity
  * ... increase cooking and deployment times
- UE4 Editor is easy to modify to
  * improve workflows
  * enforce good practices


== Asset Naming Rules
image::content-std/template.png[asset template]

- less confusion and improves searching & browsing
- `Prefix` uses _initialism_ rules


== Asset Naming Example
image::content-std/example_1.png[assets ex]


== Blueprint Standards
- Same principles as the Coding Standard
- Live in `Game/Content/Standard/`
- We have some basic automatic validators
- Best gain for us:
  * enforcing comment nodes


[%notitle]
== Blueprint Standards Ex. 1
image::content-std/blueprint-standard-1.png[blueprint std ex 1]



[%notitle]
== Blueprint Standards Ex. 2
image::content-std/blueprint-standard-2.png[blueprint std ex 2]


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-5.jpg"]
== Content *Standards*


== Automated Validation
- CI (Continuous Integration) support
  * validation after submit
  * nightly builds
- Naming Validation
- Blueprints Validation
- Assets Validation


== Asset Naming Validator
- Automated checker / validator
  * Editor commandlet
  * _Initialism_ from asset class name
    * extra JSON file with exceptions
- Disallows names like `Test`, `Prototype`, `Error`
- Intercept new asset creation


== Asset auto-naming on creation
image::content-std/ue4-auto-naming.gif"[auto naming, width="150%"]


== Asset import rule
- Disallow import from non-versioned paths
- Forbidden example:
  * Adding data from own Desktop folder üíÄ


== Blueprints Validation
- Editor commandlet
- Basic checks
  * comment nodes present
  * public functions / vars must have tooltips
  * no functions / vars with default names
- Future work / ideas
  * leverage the Blueprint Compiler
  * more complex checks


== Assets Validation 
- Checks for bad or missing references
  * disregards *Developer*, *Test* folders
- Executed via cooking:
  * `-COOKALL -DUMPALLWARNINGS -WARNINGSASERRORS`
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è 
  * not viable for large projects
    * explore other possibilities
    * ex: dependency walker via Asset Registry


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-T.jpg"]
== *Compilation*

== Hardware
- Everyday work is very CPU intensive
- CPU hardware threads
  * jump from 8 to 16 substantial (2x)
  * same from 16 to 32
  * diminishing returns after
- Distributed compilation
  * _Incredibuild_ for some projects
  * we also tried _Fastbuild_
    * free but more difficult to integrate


== Build Farm
- Configuration / layout different per project
- Sweetspot price / performance for us 32 thread CPUs
  * Good performer: 16c/32t AMD Threadripper 1950x
- Orchestration
  * _TeamCity_ - most projects
  * _Jenkins_


== Infrastructure-As-Code
- In the past we used ad-hoc methods that didn't scale well
  * too tight integrated with the CI orchestrator
  * too bespoke for a project - cannot reuse
  * hard to debug locally
- Now leveraging Epic's own _BuildGraph_


== BuildGraph
- Alternative to traditional `BuildCookRun` automation commands
- XML based scripts

== BuildGraph - Our Usage
- Standardized and reusable set of scripts
- Unifies all calling paths
    * Visual Studio
    * Editor - Hot Reload
    * command line
    * CI systems


== BuildGraph (cont.)
- Additional benefits
  * easier edit in Visual Studio than batch files
  * allows build tasks parallelizing
  * easier dependencies management
- Our most complex use-case:
  * prepare _UnrealGameSync_ editor binaries
    * multi-step process, with artefact dependencies

  ]}
/>


== How it works
- Effectively 2 systems working together
- Frontend
  * what the devs interact with
- Backend
  * CI / build-machines


== Pre-Commit Frontend
- Tools that allow indirect submits to main code base
- Off-the-shelf
  * Visual Studio ReSharper Team City plugin
  * https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/
- Internally developed
  * more project specific
  * written in C# or Python  


== Example: Visual Studio ReSharper
image::tools/pre-commit.png[resharper, width="50%"]

== Pre-Commit Backend
- *Personal Build* system
  * starts CI build configuration in isolation
  * more configurations -> better coverage üòäÔ∏è
  * more configurations -> stress on build farm ‚òπÔ∏è


== Pre-Commit Backend (cont.)
- Compile time-saving solution
  * rebuild all participating configuration nightly
  * incremental (non-unity) builds throughout the day
  * example:
    * _Editor_ + _Game(PC)_ + _Game(PS4)_
    * Overnight: 1.5-2h on fastest machine
    * Daily: 5-15 min per commit check


== Workflow & Rules
- Every commit validated against:
  * Has _title_ and _description_
  * Contains at least of _tag_ like `[Feature]` `[Bug]` `[Merge]` etc
  * Has links to _code review_ or code _buddies_
  * Time-limits to prevent commit-and-runs
- Some projects relax or constrain the rules more
  * example: check against known build-breaking patterns
    * (missing .h/.cpp pair)

[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/DB-1.jpg"]
== Automation & *Testing*

== Unit Testing
- Testing plain classes and structs or single UObjects
- Enhancements to UE4's own framework
  * follow Given / When / Then structure
  * separate standards file 
  * integrated with CI (ex: TeamCity)
  * utilities
    * import private data from testable modules
    * `UWorld` setup & teardown


== Unit Test Code Surf

    { range: [69, 72], notes: "...Then" },
    { range: [77, 79], notes: "cleanup" }
  ]}
/>


== Functional Testing
- Blueprint actors that we embed in bespoke levels using the editor
- Live under `Game/Content/Test/...`
- Named `FTEST_` to follow Epic's convention and for visibility
- Not network capable
  * Look into recent UE4 additions: _Gauntlet_


== CI Tests Integration
image::tools/tc-tests.png[TC tests]


== Editor Automated Distribution
UnrealGameSync (UGS)

- Distributing Editor binaries is a more controlled manner
- Very useful for non-programmers
  * we stripped out the compilation support
- We refactored the packaging script via BuildGraph
  * more control, adding symbols upload


== Editor Build Validation
- Basic automated Editor validation
  * build machine boots freshly compiled Editor
  * monitors error messages in the log
  * monitors startup time (ex: no more than X sec)


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/GOW-Brumak.jpg"]
== *Projects* Setup


== Game Modules
- We strive to have multiple independent modules
  * as opposed to 1 monolithic one
- Beneficial for
  * encapsulation and architecture
  * faster iteration (linkage improvement for ex)
  * support for Hot-Reload
  * re-use throughout projects

    { range: [5, 8], notes: "Implementation" },
    { range: [10, 14], notes: "Interface" }
  ]}
/>


== Quick & Dirty Automation
- `GenerateModule.cmd`
- Batch file script that produces
  * folder structure
  * initial _...build.cs_ file with good defaults for us

WORK: open src and add link


== Test Modules
- Very useful to access private data from equivalent runtime module
- Our solution: `MODULENAME_TEST_API` extension to module API specifier
  * UnrealBuildTool modification
  * exported as usual
  * only modules with `bImportTestModuleSymbols` can import


[state=title_card]
[%notile, background-image="cards/DB-2.jpg"]
== *Splash* Engine


== About
We extract and re-use the UE work across projects into "Splash Engine"

- game-agnostic engine enhacements & fixes gathered across time
- re-usable mini-frameworks modules
  * UI components
  * Audio utilities
  * Events, Async Tasks
  * Rendering features
  * Tech-Art utilities
    * ex: Instance Mesh split /group


== Overview
- Majority of projects get seeded from "Splash Engine"
- Downstream integrations
  * "Splash Engine" tends to be at latest UE4 version
  * projects update at their own pace
- Upstream integrations
  * some projects will bubble-up important features

== Summary
- Allows us to have quick integrations
- Decouples main game dev work from integration work
- Keeps "Splash Engine" updated and in good condition
