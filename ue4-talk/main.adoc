== Standard Test
[source, cpp]
-----
// [ue.gen.struct] [ue.ecs.group] move groups of Blueprint exposed variables into separate structures
//	this helps refactoring and takes the stress out of interfaces
//	for ex implementation-only functions can just take the group as an argument
//	NOTE: this is not always possible, but highly desirable for "config" like variables
USTRUCT(BlueprintType)
struct FBMCodingStandardBlueprintVarGroup
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

    // [vs.plugin] some good tools to help manage these special meta attributes
    //	it's a pain to write them by hand

== Existing Coding Standards
Everbody and their grandma try to establish coding styles/standards

- C++ standard
  * everything is lowercase like_this
- Google style guide
  * https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
- Epic's own
  * https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CodingStandard

== Enforcing a Style
