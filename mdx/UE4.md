---
## Disclaimer

- Share our learnings
  * what worked well üëç
  * what didn't üëé
- Get inspired!

---
## Teams and Projects

- 300 employees
- Split across multiple ongoing projets
- Most projects use **Splash Engine**
  * vanilla UE4 + own modules and enhancements

# Coding Standards
    </div>
  </Box>
</Image>

---
## About

- Usually as standalone documentation (_pdf_, _wiki_, etc)
- People are supposed to study them
  * then apply in practice

---
## Pitfalls

- Grow big / Hard to navigate
- Get _out-of-date_ quickly
- In separate location
  * outside production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! üòõ

---
## Splash Damage approach

- Standards are **source code files** üìë
  - you can break the build messing with the standard!
- Created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy _reference_ and _searching_

---
## The Coding Standards

* 2 files
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.h`
  * `SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp`
* Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`
* Open Source
  * https://github.com/splash-damage/coding-standards

---
## Tagging

- Inspired by the C++ ISO standard itself
  * ex: `21.9.4  Initializer list range`
  * `access [support.initlist.range]`
- Allows easy _search_ and _reference_
- Handy in code reviews

---
## Usage

Applied via code reviews

<br/>

![review](img/code-std/review-1.png)

---
## Usage (continued)

Takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental

<br/>

![review](img/code-std/review-2.png)

---
## Modify and Improve

The standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team

If enough up-votes the proposal gets submitted üëç

# Content Standards
    </div>
  </Box>
</Image>

---
## Motivation

- Poor organisation and practices for assets
  * ...compound over time
  * ...waste productivity
  * ...increase cooking and deployment times
- UE4 Editor is easy to modify to
  * improve workflows
  * enforce good practices

---
## Asset naming rules

![asset naming](img/content-std/template.png)

- less confusion and improves searching & browsing
- `Prefix` and `BaseAssetName` are mandatory

---
## Example

![asset examples](img/content-std/example_1.png)

---
## Enforcing

- Automated checker / validator
  * Editor commandlet
  * uses preset JSON list
  * matches asset type against name
- Intercept new asset creation

---

  ]}
/>

---
## Enforcing (cont.)

<img src="img/content-std/ue4-auto-naming.gif" alt="auto naming" width="150%"
  style={{marginLeft: "-25%"}} />

---
## Blueprint Standards

- Same principles as the Coding Standard
- Live in `Game/Content/Standard/`
- We have some basic automatic validators
- Best gain for us:
  * enforcing comment nodes

---

# Content Validation
    </div>
  </Box>
</Image>

---
## Automated Validation

- CI (Continuous Integration) support
  * validation after submit
  * nightly builds
- Blueprints Validation
- Assets Validation

---
## Blueprints Validation

- Editor commandlet
- Basic checks
  * comment nodes present
  * public functions / vars must have tooltips
  * no functions / vars with default names
- Future work / ideas
  * leverage the Blueprint Compiler
  * more complex checks

---
## Assets Validation 

- Checks for bad or missing references
  * disregards *Developer*, *Test* folders
- Executed via cooking:
  * `-COOKALL -DUMPALLWARNINGS -WARNINGSASERRORS`
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è 
  * not viable for large projects
    * explore other possibilities
    * ex: dependency walker via Asset Registry

# Compilation
    </div>
  </Box>
</Image>

---
## Hardware

- Everyday work is very CPU intensive
- CPU hardware threads
  * jump from 8 to 16 substantial (2x)
  * same from 16 to 32
  * dimishing returns after
- Distributed compilation
  * _Incredibuild_ for some projects
  * we also tried _Fastbuild_
    * free but more difficult to integrate

---
## Build Farm

- Configuration / layout different per project
- Sweetspot price / performance for us 32 thread CPUs
  * Good performer: 16c/32t AMD Threadripper 1950x
- Orchestration
  * _TeamCity_ - most projects
  * _Jenkins_

---
## Infrastructure-As-Code

- In the past we used ad-hoc methods that didn't scale well
  * too tight integrated with the CI orchestrator
  * too bespoke for a project - cannot reuse
  * hard to debug locally
- Now leveraging Epic's own _BuildGraph_

---
## BuildGraph

- Alternative to traditional `BuildCookRun` automation commands
- XML based scripts

* How we use it
  * standardized and reusable set of scripts
  * unifies all calling paths
    * Visual Studio
    * Editor - Hot Reload
    * command line
    * CI systems

---
## BuildGraph (cont.)

- Additional benefits
  * easier edit in Visual Studio than batch files
  * allows build tasks parallelizing
  * easier dependencies management
- Our most complex use-cases:
  * prepare Unreal Game Sync editor binaries
  * code/data submit-dependency flagging

TODO: maybe talk UBT/UAT in P4 (pre-commit for them)

---
## How it works

- Effectively 2 systems working together
- Frontend
  * what the devs interact with
- Backend
  * CI / build-machines

---
## Pre-Commit Frontend

- Tools that allow indirect submits to main code base
- Off-the-shelf
  * Visual Studio ReSharper Team City plugin
  * https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/
- Internally developed
  * more project specific
  * written in C# or Python  

---
## Example: Visual Studio ReSharper

<div style={{float: "left", display: "inline", textAlign: "left"}}>
<br/>
<br/>
Build configurations<br/>
to check against ----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Options to auto-commit<br/>
only on success -----------------------------------
</div>

<img alt="resharper" src="img/tools/pre-commit.png" width="50%"
style={{float: "right", display: "inline"}} />

---
## Pre-Commit Backend

- *Personal Build* system
  * starts CI build configuration in isolation
  * more configurations -> better coverage üòäÔ∏è
  * more configurations -> stress on build farm ‚òπÔ∏è
- Compile time-saving solution
  * rebuild all participating configuration nightly
  * incremental (non-unity) builds throughout the day
  * example:
    * _Editor_ + _Game(PC)_ + _Game(PS4)_
    * Overnight: 1.5-2h on fastest machine
    * Daily: 5-15 min per commit check

---
## Workflow & Rules

- Every commit validated against:
  * Has _title_ and _description_
  * Contains at least of _tag_ like `[Feature]` `[Bug]` `[Merge]` etc
  * Has links to _code review_ or code _buddies_
  * Time-limits to prevent commit-and-runs
- Some projects relax or constrain the rules more
  * example: check against known build-breaking patterns
    * (missing .h/.cpp pair)

---
# Automation & Testing

---
## Unit Testing

- Testing plain classes and structs or single UObjects
- Enhancements to UE4's own framework
  - follow Given / When / Then structure
  - separate standards file 
  - integrated with CI (ex: TeamCity)
  - utilities
    * import private data from testable modules
    * `UWorld` setup & teardown

---
<CodeSurfer

    { range: [52, 53], notes: "test names must follow specific naming" },
    { range: [54, 58], notes: "Given..." },
    { range: [65, 67], notes: "...When..." },
    { range: [69, 72], notes: "...Then" },
    { range: [77, 79], notes: "cleanup" }
  ]}
/>

---
## Functional Testing

- Blueprint actors that we embed in bespoke levels using the editor
- Live under `Game/Content/Test/...`
- Named `FTEST_` to follow Epic's convention and for visibility
- Not network capable
  * Look into recent UE4 additions: _Gauntlet_

---
## CI Tests Integration

![CI tests](img/tools/tc-tests.png)

---
## Editor automation

- UnrealGameSync (UGS)
  * distributing Editor binaries is a more controlled manner
  * very useful for non-programmers
    * we stripped out the compilation support
  * we refactored the packaging script via BuildGraph
    * more control, adding symbols upload
- Basic automated Editor validation
  * build machine boots freshly compiled Editor
  * watches for crashes by monitoring logs

SLIDE: split in 2 slides
WORK: get info on editor run problems

---
# Projects Setup

---
## Game Modules

- We strive to have multiple independent modules
  * as opposed to 1 monolithic one
- Beneficial for
  * encapsulation and architecture
  * faster iteration (linkage improvement for ex)
  * support for Hot-Reload
  * re-use throughout projects

# Splash Engine

---
## About

We extract and re-use the UE work across projects into "Splash Engine"

- game-agnostic engine enhacements & fixes gathered across time
- re-usable mini-frameworks modules
  * UI components
  * Audio thin abstractions
  * Events, Async Tasks
  * Rendering features
  * Tech-Art utilities
    * ex: Instance Mesh split /group

---
## Overview

- Majority of projects get seeded from "Splash Engine"
- Downstream integrations
  * "Splash Engine" tends to be at latest UE4 version
  * projects update at their own pace
- Upstream integrations
  * some projects will bubble-up important features
