## Tasks

SYS: theme of code-surfer better contrast of dimmed code
SYS: find solution for incremental lists https://github.com/kyleshevlin/react-edges
SYS: try embed code-surfer in react.js
SYS: find solution for header/footer
DECK: change theme to white or bigger impact black
DECK: increase font sizes
DECK: separate the sections with img's (badlands style) ideas: games or blurred screenshot of something u

---
## Teams and Projects

* how we run multiple Projects
* how we share information
* splash-engine

SLIDE: expand teams/prj

---
# Coding Standards

TODO: code std insert subset of separate talk

---
# Content Standards

---
## Motivation

- Content creation and management is an integral part of development
- Poor organisation and practices for assets
  * compound over time
  * waste productivity
  * increase cooking and deployment times
- UE4 Editor is easy to modify to
  * improve workflows
  * enforce good practices

---
## Definitions

![asset naming](img/content-std/template.png)

- Asset naming rules
  * less confusion and improves searching/browsing
  * `Prefix` and `BaseAssetName` are mandatory

---
## Example

![asset examples](img/content-std/example_1.png)

---
## Enforcing

- Automated checker / validator
  * Editor commandlet
  * uses preset JSON list
  * matches asset type against name
- Intercept new asset creation

WORK: screenshot of asset naming

---
## Enforcing (cont.)

WORK: get JSON asset names
SLIDE: JSON asset names code surfer
WORK: get content folder structure

---
## Blueprint Standards

WORK: talk to Tam if still used / any good & get screenshot 

---
# Content Validation

---
## Automated Validation

- CI (Continuous Integration) support
  * validation after submit
  * nightly builds
- Blueprints Validation
- Assets Validation

---
## Blueprints Validation

- Editor commandlet
- Basic checks
  - comment nodes present
  - maximum number of nodes
- Future work: leverage the Blueprint Compiler

WORK: blueprint valid - what other checks / screenshot of report

---
## Assets Validation 

- checks for bad/missing references
- disregards *Developer*, *Test* folders
- executed via cooking: `-COOKALL -WARNINGASERROR`

WORK: get all cook validation flags
SLIDE: talk about other solutions
WORK: screenshot of content validation errors / TC report

---
# Compilation

---
## Hardware

- Everyday work is very CPU intensive
- CPU cores
  *  8 -> 16: ~95% performance increase
  * 16 -> 32: 1.7x faster
  * 16 -> 64: 2.1x faster
- RAM
  * 16-64 GB TODO: confirm
- Disk space
  * 1 TB SSD + 2 TB mechanical drive
  * some projects push requirements (more SSD's, larger mechanical)

---
## Build Farm

- Configuration / layout different per project
- Sweetspot for price/performance for us 32 thread CPUs
  * Good performer: 16c/32t Threadripper 1950x
- Orchestration
  * TeamCity majority of projects
  * Jenkins as well

WORK: what does Gander have?
SLIDE: is it worth showing the table with hardware types / times?

---
## Infrastructure-As-Code

- In the past we used ad-hoc methods that didn't scale well
  * too tight integrated with the CI orchestrator
  * too bespoke for a project - cannot reuse
  * hard to debug locally
- Now leveraging Epic's own _Buildgraph_

WORK: get scr of TC big list of steps

---
## BuildGraph

* talk about UBT and traditional build/cook/run scripts
* unify all paths
* minimal solution support
* consistent scripts
* project files ready
* infrastructure as code
  * we support both TeamCity and Jenkins
* what we modified

SLIDE: refactor and expand buildgraph

---
# Pre-Commit

## How it works

- Effectively 2 systems working together
- Frontend
  * what the devs interact with
- Backend
  * CI / build-machines

---
## Pre-Commit Frontend

- Tools that allow indirect submits to main code base
- Off-the-shelf
  * Visual Studio ReSharper Team City plugin
  * https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/
- Internally developed
  * more project specific
  * written in C# or Python  

---
## Example: Visual Studio ReSharper

![resharper](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/image4.png)

WORK: better/bigger Resharper pic (of our own)

---
## Example: Internal Tools

SLIDE: pic of CVT

WORK: pic of Bogdan's new tool

---
## Pre-Commit Backend

- *Personal Build* system
  * starts CI build configuration in isolation
  * more configurations -> better coverage üòäÔ∏è
  * more configurations -> stress on build farm ‚òπÔ∏è
- Compile time-saving solution
  * rebuild all participating configuration over nightly
  * incremental (non-unity) builds throughout the day
  * example:
    * Editor Dev build + Main game Dev build + PS4 build
    * Overnight: 1.5-2h on fastest machine
    * Daily: 5-15 min per commit check

---
## Workflow & Rules

- Experiments with commit time-locks
  * 9am to 6pm to decrease chances of commit  
  * engine changes only after 5pm because they disrupt Pre-Commit cache
- Every commit validated against:
  * Has _title_ and _description_
  * Contains at least of _tag_ like `[Feature]` `[Bug]` `[Merge]` etc
  * Has links to _code review_ and code _buddies_
- Some projects relax or constrain the rules more
  * example: check against known build-breaking patterns (missing .h/.cpp pair)

---
# Automation & Testing

---
## Unit Testing

- Testing plain classes and structs or single UObjects
- Enhancements to UE4's own framework
  - follow Given/When/Then structure
  - separate standard file 
  - integrated with CI (ex: TeamCity)

WORK: grab test standard
WORK: check the SDTestHarness
WORK: grab TC test screenshot
SLIDE: talk about Importing private symbols / MODULENAME_TEST_API

---
## Functional Testing

- Blueprint actors that we embed in bespoke levels using the editor
- Live under `Content/Test/...`
- Named `FTEST_` to follow Epic's convention and for visibility
- Not network capable
  * Look into recent UE4 additions: _Gauntlet_

WORK: functional test video / screenshot
WORK: clarify if we have functional tests in code

---
## UGS

- how we use it
- our modification
- rewrote UGS script
- code-data dependency

TODO: should I even cover it?

---
# Projects Setup

---
## Game Modules

- We strive to have multiple independent modules rather than 1 monolithic one
- Beneficial for
  * encapsulation and architecture
  * faster iteration (linkage improvement for ex)
  * support for Hot-Reload
  * re-use throughout projects

TODO: mention automation and record gif of module creation
WORK: get module batch file

---
## Splash Engine

- We extract and re-use the UE work across projects into "Splash Engine"
- Consists of:
  * game-agnostic engine changes/enhacements/fixes gathered across time
  * re-usable mini-frameworks modules:
    * UI components
    * Audio thin abstractions
    * Events, Async Tasks
    * Utilities
- Majority of projects get seeded from "Splash Engine"
  * merges/integrations can happen both upstream and downstream
- Integrates latest UE4 versions

TODO: diagram of projects layout
TODO: Epic new version example integration

# Tools

TODO: quick intro and mention how we will show them for inspiration
TODO: mention across project and within projects
TODO: example screenshots and quick notes about: PCT, CVT, Trigger

WORK: talk to Mark V about TA tools
WORK: get tools screenshots (CVT, PCT, trigger xml)
