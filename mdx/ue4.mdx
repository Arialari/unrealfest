## Tasks

TODO: change theme to white or bigger impact black

TODO: increase font sizes

TODO: find solution for incremental lists https://github.com/kyleshevlin/react-edges

TODO: try embed code-surfer in react.js

TODO: find solution for header/footer

TODO: separate the sections with img's (badlands style) ideas: games or blurred screenshot of something u

---
## Company history

TODO: history timeline from marketing

---
## UE4 games

* Gears Ultimate Edition
* Gears 4 and 5
* Gears Tactics
* Chelan
* multiple announced titles

TODO: pic montage from marketing

---
## Teams and Projects

* how we run multiple Projects
* how we share information
* splash-engine

TODO: expand on this

---
## Coding Standards

TODO: code std insert subset of separate talk

---
## Content Standards

---
## Motivation

- Content creation and management is an integral part of development
- Poor organisation and practices for assets
  * compound over time
  * waste productivity
  * increase cooking and deployment times
- UE4 Editor is easy to modify to
  * improve workflows
  * enforce good practices

---
## Definitions

![asset naming](img/content-std/template.png)

- Asset naming rules
  * less confusion and improves searching/browsing
  * `Prefix` and `BaseAssetName` are mandatory

---
## Example

![asset examples](img/content-std/example_1.png)

---
## Blueprint Standards

TODO: blueprint std screenshot

TODO: talk to Tam if still used / any good 

---
## Enforcing

- Automated checker / validator
  * Editor commandlet
  * uses preset JSON list
  * matches asset type against name
- Intercept new asset creation
  * TODO: screenshot

---
## Enforcing (cont.)

TODO: code scroll of the JSON list

TODO: content folder structure

---
## Content Validation

---
## Automated Validation

- CI (Continuos Integration) support
  * validation after submit
  * nightly builds
- Blueprints Validation
- Assets Validation

---
## Blueprints Validation

- Editor commandlet
- basic checks
  - comment nodes present
  - maximum number of nodes
  - TODO: what other
- future work: leverage the Blueprint Compiler
- TODO: screenshot of errors maybe

---
## Assets Validation 

- checks for bad/missing references
- disregards *Developer*, *Test* folders
- executed via cooking: `-COOKALL -WARNINGASERROR` TODO: actual flags
- TODO: talk about other solutions
- TODO: screenshot of some errors

---
## Pre-Commit

<CodeSurfer

  code={require("!raw-loader!../flow/submit.txt")}

## How it works

- Effectively 2 systems working together
- Frontend
  * what the devs interact with
- Backend
  * CI / build-machines

---
## Pre-Commit Frontend

- Tools that allow indirect submits to main code base
- Off-the-shelf
  * Visual Studio ReSharper Team City plugin
  * https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/
- Internally developed
  * more project specific
  * written in C# or Python  

---
## Example: Visual Studio ReSharper

TODO: better/bigger pic (of our own)

---
## Example: Internal Tools

TODO: pic of CVT

TODO: pic of Bogdan's new tool

---
## Pre-Commit Backend

- *Personal Build* system
  * starts CI build configuration in isolation
  * more configurations -> better coverage üòäÔ∏è
  * more configurations -> stress on build farm ‚òπÔ∏è
- Compile time-saving solution
  * rebuild all participating configuration over nightly
  * incremental (non-unity) builds throughout the day
  * example:
    * Editor Dev build + Main game Dev build + PS4 build
    * Overnight: 1.5-2h on fastest machine
    * Daily: 5-15 min per commit check

---
## buildgraph

* talk about UBT and traditional build/cook/run scripts
  * disadvantages with this TODO: screenshot with multistep Raptor shit
* unify all paths
* minimal solution support
* consistent scripts
* project files ready
* infrastructure as code
  * we support both TeamCity and Jenkins
* what we modified

---
## UGS

  * how we use it
  * our modification
  * rewrote UGS script
  * code-data dependency

---
## Other

- testing
  * TODO: understand from work
- game structure
  * modules (types & layout)
- tools
  * code reviews tools
  * PCT 
  * CVT
  * Trigger
