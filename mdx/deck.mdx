## About

TODO: full screen pic

---
## What are Coding Standards TODO: too big font

TODO: quotes from wiki

---
## Well known examples

- C++ standard
  * everything is lowercase like_this
- Google style guide
  * https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
- Epic's own
  * https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CodingStandard
- TODO: more
- TODO: too big font
- TOOD: use URL short

---
## Enforcing / Adoption

- how they are presented (articles or PDFs)
- people are supposed to learn them thru practice
- tools ex: GLS on VS

---
## Pitfalls

- they get too big
- in separate location / repository
- only select few modify or improve them
- get out-of-date very quickly
- no time for docs, only code!

---
## Splash Damage approach

- standards are source code files!
  * you can break the build messing with the standard :)
- they are created and improved thru code reviews
- using a chapter/tag system for easy reference
