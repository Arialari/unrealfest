## What are Coding Standards

"Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language" [Wikipedia]

Formally adopted coding conventions become _standards_

---
## Examples in the wild

- C++ ISO standard promotes a specific style for naming
  - ex: all std:: types/functions are named_like_this
- C++ Code Guidelines
  - http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines
- Google style guide
  - https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
- Unreal Engine 4
  - https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CodingStandard

---
## Enforcing / Adoption

- Normally presented as standalone documentation (PDF, wiki, etc)
- People are supposed to study them the apply in practice
- Usually not machine readable
  - one exception: Microsoft Visual Studio Code Guidelines checker

---
## Pitfalls

- They will get too big
- They get out-of-date very quickly
- In separate location / repository from production source code
- Only select few modify or improve them
- Nobody has time to read documentation! :)

---
## Splash Damage approach

- Standards are source code files!
  - you can break the build messing with the standard :)
- They are created and improved through code reviews
- A system for easy reference and searching

---
## The Coding Standards

* 2 files
  * SplashDamageCodingStandard.h
  * SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp
* Located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`

<CodeSurfer
  title="The standard"
  code={require("!raw-loader!../standards/snip/overview.h")}
  lang="cpp"
  showNumbers={false}
  theme={vsDark}
  steps={[
    { notes: "the header file" },
    { range: [ 1, 15], notes: "" },
    { range: [15, 30] },

    { range: [45, 60] },
    { range: [60, 75] },
    { lines: [66], notes: "notice the chapter tagging system" }
  ]}

---
## Tagging

- inspired by the C++ standard itself (TODO: quote)
- allows easy search and reference
- handy in code reviews

---
## Walkthrough

- more architectural than strict rule-sets
- very Unreal Engine 4 focused
- cater to all experience levels

## Usage

applied via code reviews

![review](img/review-1.png)

---
## Usage (continued)

takes the pressure off from feeling judgemental 

![review](img/review-2.png)

---
## Modify and improve

the standard itself is changed though reviews sent to the whole team

if enough up-votes the proposal gets submitted

---
## Unintended consequences
