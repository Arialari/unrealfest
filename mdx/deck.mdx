## What are Coding Standards TODO: too big font

TODO: quotes from wiki

---
## Well known examples

- C++ standard
  * everything is lowercase like_this
- Google style guide
  * https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
- Epic's own
  * https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/CodingStandard
- TODO: more
- TODO: too big font
- TOOD: use URL short

---
## Enforcing / Adoption

- how they are presented (articles or PDFs)
- people are supposed to learn them thru practice
- tools ex: GLS on VS

---
## Pitfalls

- they get too big
- in separate location / repository
- only select few modify or improve them
- get out-of-date very quickly
- no time for docs, only code!

---
## Splash Damage approach

- standards are source code files!
  * you can break the build messing with the standard :)
- they are created and improved thru code reviews
- they have a system for easy reference and searching

---
## The Coding Standards

* 2 files
  * SplashDamageCodingStandard.h
  * SplashDamageCodingStandard.cpp
* located in the main source code
  * `ue4/Game/Source/Main/...`

<CodeSurfer
  title="The standard"
  code={require("!raw-loader!../standards/snip/overview.h")}
  lang="cpp"
  showNumbers={false}
  steps={[
    { notes: "the header file" },
    { range: [ 1, 15], notes: "" },
    { range: [15, 30] },
    { range: [30, 45] },
    { range: [45, 60] },
    { range: [60, 75] },
    { lines: [66], notes: "notice the chapter tagging system" }
  ]}
/>

---
## Tagging

- inspired by the C++ standard itself (TODO: quote)
- allows easy search and reference
- handy in code reviews

---
## Walkthrough

- more architectural than strict rule-sets
- very Unreal Engine 4 focused
- cater to all experience levels
